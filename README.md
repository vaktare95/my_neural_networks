This is my implementation of 2-layer perceptron artificial neural network (1 hidden layer) using only NumPy with Python3.8.

The code is adjusted to Python3.8.

The algorithm is tested (test_two_layer_perceptron.py) on MNIST dataset loaded from keras API (60k train examples, 10k test examples). The accuracy of the algorithm is over 90%.

To test the algorithm, just run:
```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
and then:
```
python3 test_two_layer_perceptron.py
```
